Advances in technology such as the invention of the internet, mobile devices, and social media to name a few mean that the Data Protection Act 1998 is no longer fit for purpose. Consequently, Europe has introduced new legislation aimed at protecting personal data in the world we\u2019re living in today, known as the General Data Protection Regulations or GDPR.\nOn this one day course you will learn:\n\nWhy your\u00a0organisation\u00a0needs to pay attention to data protection\nBackground to the GDPR\nHow GDPR will affect your\u00a0organisation\nData protection obligations on\u00a0organisations\u00a0under the 1998 Act and how these change under GDPR\nThe Brexit effect on GDPR\nNine key changes brought in by GDPR\nMandatory Data Protection Officers \u2013 when do you need one?\nChanges in territorial scope\nThe complexities of making international transfers of data\nNew responsibilities for data processors\nNew penalties and auditing powers of the ICO\nPrivacy by design\nRisks and consequences of a data breach in your\u00a0organisation\nCreate a plan to meet GDPR compliance in your\u00a0organisation\n\n\nOur Trainer\nAndrew\u00a0is a Director in two companies, Robinson Morris Ltd and Cultiv8 Training Ltd, which between them provide consultancy, training, support and advisory services to the private and public sector. He is also a member of the Fife Valuation Appeals Committee,\u00a0an independent body which assesses and decides upon disputes pertaining to Council Tax Bandings.\nAndrew\u00a0has significant experience in the application of data protection legislation and holds a Diploma in Corporate Governance; he is also certified in GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations) having recently trained in that field of expertise.\n\u00a0Andrew\u00a0was laterally Chief of Staff and Head of Corporate Governance in a Scottish public sector body, where he held strategic responsibility for Executive Support, Policy Support and the continuous development of governance, relationships and liaison with key external partners and stakeholders.

        "description": "CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. Farset Labs\u2019 CoderDojo is run by volunteers from the Farset community and offers a range of computer skills, from web application development to scratch.\nAt a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they\u2019ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.\nCoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: \u201cAbove All: Be Cool\u201c, bullying, lying, wasting people\u2019s time and so on is uncool.\nIt also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don\u2019t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!\nFor more information about Coder Dojo, check out the\u00a0CoderDojo global webpage.\nYou can also follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\n\nWhat should I bring to the event?\nIf you can, please bring your own laptop.\nCan I join as a mentor/volunteer?\nYes! We always appreciate more hands on deck, but we do need to put people through a short induction/training programme first, so get in touch with us on\u00a0dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk\u00a0and we can add you to the next induction stream.\nI can\u2019t make it, what can I do to help?\nIf you can\u2019t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at\u00a0BMC in Belfast,Ballymena, or the brand new Dojo in\u00a0Newry.\nIf you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a\u00a0donation\u00a0to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.\nIs there an age limit to enter the event?\nCoderDojo is aimed loosely at the under 18\u2019s, but any child younger than 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian and that guardian must stay on-site for the duration of the event\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\nWe\u2019re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus\nIs there a charge for the event\nFarset Labs\u2019 members operate the CoderDojo for free for all attendees, but donations to cover operating costs are greatly appreciated.\nWhat Child Protection Policies are in place?\nOnly those registered may attend, including mentors. For full details, see\u00a0Farset Labs\u2019 Child Protection Policy. At the lead mentors\u2019 discretion, the event space may be sealed off from the rest of the space.",

No topic is off limits as long as you are confident that it can be delivered to a lay audience within the constraints of the format.\nThe event is in two parts; an invited and a free-for-all section, separated by a beer, soft drink, pizza and fresh fruit intermission.\nThe Rules:\nThe rules for both groups are the same:\n\nSpeakers have a maximum of 7 minutes to speak on the subject of their choice, followed by a short open Q&A.\nNo Slides! The use of Non-Projected Visual Aids is heavily encouraged, and projectors may be considered for live demonstrations.\nBefore the event starts and during the break, presenters (invited or unplanned) are asked to put a 3-5 word synopsis of their topic on the blackboard along with their name.\nThe Comp\u00e8re will decide what order presentations will be done, so be nice to him/her!\nPunishment for rule/time violators is at the discretion of the comp\u00e8re.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got something you\u2019d like to share, sign up for the 'Speaker' ticket type or email\u00a0events@farsetlabs.org.uk\u00a0to discuss it with the subject line \u201cELI5\u201d\nSee you there!\nThe Support:\nMany thanks to The British Computing Society in Northern Ireland for continuing to support this programme for the past 4 years!",

What\u00a0flavour\u00a0and what\u00a0colour\u00a0is it?\u00a0 What size is it?\u00a0 How do we know when we have enough of it?\u00a0 Trust is a human property that cannot be created by technology so how do we engineer it to create trusted computer systems, processes\u00a0and\u00a0operations?\r\n\u00a0This session explains SABSA techniques to model demonstrable, traceable trust and ensure correct security and risk decisions at every level of the\u00a0organisation.\r\n\r\nPresenter Bio\r\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t heard of David Lynas before, he is one of three people who co-authored \u201cEnterprise Security Architecture\u201d A Business Driven Approach.

        "description": "Understanding your role as a product manager \nTraining Workshop Overview \nFoundations 101 is an overview course intended for individuals who hold the title of Product Manager, or have some working knowledge of the product development process. The intention of this course is to help product managers develop a broader understanding of their role. It seeks to answer the questions:\n\nWhat are the core functions and primary responsibilities of a product manager?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat does good product management look like?\nHow do product managers know if they are adding value?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAs such, the course is tightly focused on running an effective core team that is centered around inquiry-driven development process. Participants will improve their understanding of customer problems and perspectives, solution testing, delivery mechanisms, and team process.\n\nWhat we\u2019ll cover on the day\nFoundations 101 is a full-day workshop that is comprised of nine modules. Each module includes a lecture component on theory and practice interspersed with up to three hands-on activities. This ensures that participants are afforded an opportunity to apply and work with concepts in a setting that will answer questions and facilitate critical thinking. The following modules will be covered:\n\nLearning mindsets: How inquiry breaks down at different points through the product development lifecycle\nGoals alignment: How to create effective goals and align the team and organisation around them\nDesign thinking: What design thinking is and how product managers can break down what is needed for product understanding\nPersona development: How to effectively create personas and use them in product processes\nLean testing: Unpacking types of lean tests and how to implement them for maximum learning\nInterview guides: Writing interview guides that do not bias or lead the subject\nWireframes and prototypes: Using visuals at different fidelities to facilitate the right conversation\nUser stories: Creating an effective communication mechanism for efficient and transparent delivery\nCore team communication: How to think about \u201cculture as product\u201d and foster a team that that is geared towards continuous improvement\n\n\n\nMind the Product Trainers\nEvery Mind the Product trainer is a working product manager who has worked with multiple products and domains. Your trainer\u2019s product management experience enriches the curriculum by delivering diverse perspectives on best practice in different scenarios. You will hear about the products they have worked on in the past, what went well, what didn\u2019t go so well, and how they tried to make improvements. Our trainers\u2019 main goal is not to provide participants with all of the answers, but help facilitate them in asking the right questions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAbout Your Trainers\n\nEmma Mulholland, Senior Product Manager\nEmma has over 11 years' experience in Product.

        "description": "The Age Friendly Innovation workshop provides an opportunity for those with an interest in technology innovation for older adults to come together in an informal setting to discuss the latest developments within the area. The workshop takes place in Kirk House, an award-winning care home based in Belfast. The workshop will be opened by a brief set of relevant talks about the importance of the use of technology to maximise quality of life.\nThe main focus of the event will be an informal, interactive demonstration session. This session will consist of live demonstrations of developments in the area from academia and industry. Finally, the workshop will close with a tour of Kirk House Care Home's award-winning Memory Lane Dementia Unit.\nDue to the popularity of the event last year, the workshop will be offered in two identical sessions - both sessions will offer the same talks and demonstrations.\u00a0\nThe AM session will take place from 10:00 to 12:00.\nThe PM session will take place from 14:00 to 16:00.\nWhen registering, please select one of the sessions. Please also contact me (j.synnott@ulster.ac.uk) if you are interested in demonstrating any of your work at the workshop!\nPlease feel free to pass this invitation along to any colleagues or other organisations you believe may be interested in attending.\nLooking forward to seeing you at the event!\nJonathan Synnott\nLecturer in Data Analytics\nUlster University\nE-Mail: j.synnott@ulster.ac.uk\u00a0\nTel.: 028 9036 8952\n",

She was the Chairman of the Board of the Xerox Corporation from 2010 to 2017 and Chief Executive Officer from 2009 to 2016.\nShe joined Xerox as an intern in 1980 and during her career she has held leadership posts spanning corporate services, manufacturing and product development. She was named president in 2007. During her tenure as chief executive officer, she helped the company transform from a global leader in document technology to the world\u2019s most diversified business services company serving enterprises and governments of all sizes. Shortly after being named CEO in 2009, she spearheaded the largest acquisition in Xerox history, the $6.4 billion purchase of Affiliated Computer Services.\nMost recently in 2016, she led Xerox through a successful separation into two independent, publicly traded companies \u2013 Xerox Corporation, which is comprised of the company\u2019s Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses, and Conduent Incorporated, a business process services company.

It represents the first time we are tackling a particular theme, in this case how the manufacturing world is leveraging Artificial Intelligence. While this may appear a quite specific domain this world of problems also contains lessons that are applicable to AI generally and to other industries due to the use of multi-variate, time series approaches.</p> <p>Manufacturing is a challenging domain space which is also ripe with opportunity (to apply AI tooling), to demonstrate this we will be bringing together a series of speakers from start ups, large organisations and academia to discuss the impacts they are making in this area. From the production line to logistics, we will see how sensor based infrastructure can be combined with layers of machine learning to provide a more comprehensive and intelligent manufacturing process.</p> <p>Machine Intelligence Garage have also been kind enough to act as the sponsor, providing both food and drinks for the event! which is of course, free for all attendees :)</p> <p>Planned Agenda (Pending Speaker Details):</p> <p>6pm: Networking, Food / Drinks &amp; Introductions<br/>6.30pm: Talk 1 - Large Enterprise #1<br/>7pm: Talk 2 - Enterprise<br/>7.30pm: Talk 3 - Academia<br/>8pm: Talk 4 - Start-up / Scale-up<br/>8.30pm: Panel Discussion<br/>9pm: Networking &amp; Close</p>",

        "description": "Calling all Engineers!\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrimary Engineer\u00a0are delighted to invite you to attend a local training day taking place on 2nd October 2018 at ThalesUK, Belfast.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHere at Primary Engineer we provide STEM CPD training to teachers which links practical maths and science to design technology and engineering projects. We see the benefit of linking Engineers like yourself with local primary schools - to not only inspire and educate young people, but also to create future generations of engineers.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAt this training event you will be linked with a school and you will be required to attend sessions in school in order to help teachers and pupils to participate. This\u00a0will\u00a0count towards the UK required\u00a0competencies for progression within your chosen institutions, as\u00a0activities for your CPD.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe course overview is as follows:\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis is our original \u2018STEM by Stealth\u2019\u00a0programme providing children the opportunity\u00a0to engage in exciting practical maths,\u00a0science and literacy projects using\u00a0engineering as the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning session is taken up with the design and manufacture of the Apprentice Level model, the shoebox vehicle. Teachers will work with engineers to produce their own design of vehicle, and use tools and techniques safely.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon session sees the delegates manufacture the Engineering Level vehicle, which is controlled by batteries, motor and a switch. The vehicle will travel forwards and backwards and climb a ramp, and have a removable cover which will be designed at school by the pupils.\u00a0Teachers will again work alongside engineers in the practical aspects.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWe endeavour to have tea, coffee and water available throughout the day, so breaks can be taken as and when needed during the practical sessions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you on the day!\r\n\u00a0",

Lessons from 25 years of research\u201d\r\nby\r\nProfessor Philip Griffiths, Professor of Building Physics\r\nEnergy is central to our whole way of life, but when we consume energy do we really think what we are trying to achieve? The building sector, along with transport is our largest consumer of energy through a system of centralised power generation and increasingly gas consumption. Climate change, resource depletion and pollution abatement has driven efforts to replace fossil fuels over the last 50 years, but how do we achieve this while continuing to have the same convenience and comfort that we have come to expect?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis lecture is open to everyone.\r\n\u00a0",

        "description": "The\u00a0tidyverse\u00a0is essential for any statistician or data scientist\u00a0who deals with data on a day-to-day basis. By focusing on small key tasks, the tidyverse\u00a0suite of packages removes the pain of data manipulation. This training course covers key aspects of the tidyverse, including dplyr, lubridate, tidyr and tibbles.\nCourse Structure\nTibbles\nThe core tidyverse data structure is a tibble; this is a modern take on the data frame.The course commences with a brief introduction to this structure.\n\nWhat are they?\nHow do they differ from data frames?\nConvert a data frame to a tibble and back\nWhy tibbles \u2013 motivation for the other tidyverse packages and sets the theme for the day\n\ndplyr: the workhorse of the tidyverse\nBefore the first coffee break, we\u2019ll tackle the dplyr package. This package forms the foundation of the tidyverse by providing a standardised data manipulation grammar.\n\nWhat is\u00a0dplyr?\nThe grammar of tidyverse functions\nfilter(),\u00a0summarise()\u00a0\u2013 it may be that a review of boolean algebra is necessary at this point for subsetting\nThe pipe operator\u00a0%>%\u00a0and chaining functions into a workflow\nSome other useful dplyr functions\u00a0group_by()\n\nTidy data\nYour data should be tidy. An obvious statement, except what do we mean by tidy? This section will elucidate what we mean by tidy data and how to make it part of our workflow.\n\nTidy data\n\nWhat is tidy data?\n\n\nUsing\u00a0tidyr\n\nspread()\u00a0and\u00a0gather()\u00a0for reshaping data\nseperate()\u00a0and\u00a0unite()\u00a0for splitting data into one column or the reverse\ndealing with missing values\n\n\nJoins for dealing with data split across multiple data frames\n\nData Input/Output\nIn order to manipulate data, we need to be able to load data into R. We\u2019ll cover the key packages and provide advice as required.\n\nData storage: practical advice for managing data\nTidyverse packages\n\nreadr\u00a0and\u00a0readxl\u00a0for dealing with .csv and .xls/.xlsx files\nDatabase connections\n\n\nNon-tidyverse packages\n\nNot all data sets can be loaded using tidyverse packages\nforeign\u00a0package for reading data from other statistical systems (SAS, SPSS, Minitab)\n\n\n\nData manipulation\nWe\u2019ll finish the day by looking at common difficulties that may crop up in a data scientist\u2019s day\n\nDates/times with the\u00a0lubridate\u00a0package\nString manipulation with\u00a0stringr\n\nFirst steps in regular expressions\n\n\nIf you are interested in this course you can also contact us directly for information about how you can study at our offices for a lower price.\nFor more information please go to our website at\u00a0Jumpingrivers.com",

As a continuation of this, we are collaborating with them to co-host a lightning talks event for those that want to try their hand, or practice some more ahead of other events.</p> <p>We are looking for new and beginner speakers to present 5-15 minute lightening talks to a supportive, women-dominated, techie audience.</p> <p>These talks can be about anything related in some way to tech; you do not need to be a coder; you do not have attended the workshops or any WIT event previously; you do not need to take questions at the end of the presentation if you don\u2019t want to; you can be at any level in industry (and we welcome a mix!); the presentation can be in whatever format, and as (in)formal as you like.</p> <p>Be brave; be seen, be heard; and lean in! You have plenty of time to prepare so\u2026do it! Nominate yourself to speak at the event here: <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/ib6NBAo8SneAcaQh2' class='linkified'>https://goo.gl/forms/ib6NBAo8SneAcaQh2</a></p> <p>For reference; the following resources were shared after WIT's previous events:</p> <p>Idea Generation:<br/>- Slides: <a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_ajhMg4goGGfn_3OFGVv9QWzS5m_Mfiu' class='linkified'>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_ajhMg4goGGfn_3OFGVv9QWzS5m_Mfiu</a><br/>- Video: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pL85qp3Hg' class='embedded'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pL85qp3Hg</a></p> <p>Writing (Technical) Talks:<br/>Blogs from panelists:<br/>- <a href='https://hackernoon.com/writing-a-tech-talk-using-storytelling-techniques-ff116392b4d8' class='linkified'>https://hackernoon.com/writing-a-tech-talk-using-storytelling-techniques-ff116392b4d8</a><br/>- <a href='https://njmcode.github.io/blog/2018/04/25/writing-tech-talks.html' class='linkified'>https://njmcode.github.io/blog/2018/04/25/writing-tech-talks.html</a></p> <p>Presentation Skills:<br/>- Slides: <a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1injpb_oNSTKYmgI6z8MzTY7oFfHWMJZQ' class='linkified'>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1injpb_oNSTKYmgI6z8MzTY7oFfHWMJZQ</a></p> <p>\u2022 Important to know:<br/>This is a free event aimed at women and other minority groups wishing to raise their public profile in the technology industry.</p> <p>Doors 18.00 for 18.30 start.

        "description": "The Psychedelic Press is turning 10 years old on the 1 December 2018. \r\nTo celebrate our birthday, the crew, authors and various friends in the psychedelic community are going on a short speaking tour.\r\nWriters on Drugs\u00a0is a celebratory series of full-day and evening events that address psychedelics in all their multifarious guises - from the latest cutting-edge science, to religious and magical thinking, ecology, and the role they've played in the history and culture of the world.\u00a0These extraordinary substances are deeply woven into the fabric of human life; a fact that Psychedelic Press publications have always explored, and which our speakers and authors would like to share with you!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nSPEAKERS:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNikki Wyrd:\u00a0\u2018Psychedelic Ecology: What Lives in our Heads?\u2019\r\nNikki enjoys helping people communicate their thoughts. She is a director of the charity \u2018Breaking Convention\u2019 (a biennial conference on psychedelics), Editor of the Psychedelic Press Journal, runs The Universe Machine publishing house, and works as a freelance proofreader/copyeditor; her assistance is found in most of the notable psychedelic books of recent years. With Julian Vayne, she co-authored\u00a0The Book of Baphomet, which beautifully blends scientific rationale with magickal actions. She has a growing reputation as an inspirational retreat leader. Her past roles include British Isles Section Head of the Chaos Magic order The Illuminates of Thanateros, Ecology graduate, bass player in an all-women punk band, and single mother.\r\nDanny Nemu: \u2018Getting High with the Most High: Entheogens in the Bible\u2019\r\nDanny\u00a0is a writer, activist and ayahuasca researcher with academic background in the History and Philosophy of Medicine. He first encountered ayahuasca when living in Japan, and eventually followed the trail back to the source of Daime in the Brazilian Amazon. He was bitten by a sandfly, which proved to be a great teacher. The resulting 8 month battle with a necrotic parasite provided a window into Daime ritual technologies, and an opportunity to explore the meaning of illness and health from a different point of view.\u00a0His books include\u00a0Science Revealed\u00a0and\u00a0Neuro-Apocalypse\r\nJulian Vayne:\u00a0Talk title TBA\r\nJulian\u00a0is a British occultist with over three decades of experience of esoteric culture: from Druidry to Chaos Magick, from indigenous American shamanism through to Freemasonry and Wicca.\u00a0During this time Julian has written for numerous underground esoteric journals, contributed to various collections of essays, led workshops, retreats and facilitated a wide range of group ceremonies.\u00a0He is a founding member of Transform Drug Policy Foundation and Chair of The Friends of The Boscastle Museum of Witchcraft, and his books include:\u00a0Pharmakon: Drugs and the Imagination,\u00a0Magick Works: Stories of occultism in theory and practice\u00a0and\u00a0Deep Magic Begins here\u2026 \u00a0and\u00a0Getting Higher: The Manual of Psychedelic Ceremony.\u00a0He\u2019s also co-authored \u00a0Now That\u2019s What I Call Chaos Magick\u00a0(with Greg Humphries),The Book of Baphomet\u00a0(with Nikki Wyrd) and most recently\u00a0Chaos Craft\u00a0(with Steve Dee).\u00a0\r\nReanne Crane:\u00a0\u2018Recipes for Living and Loving: Laura Huxley\u2019s Psychedelic Self-Help\u2019\r\nReanne is a PhD candidate based at the University of Kent, within the Faculty of English. Her research is centred around the philosophy of language vis-a-vis altered/alternative states of consciousness, focusing on \u2018affective openness\u2019 and the power of poetic language. She has a background in teaching and translation, with a B.A in Mandarin Chinese and English Literature, and an M.A in Contemporary Literature.\r\nPeter Sj\u00f6stedt-H: \u2018Psychedelics and the Philosophy of Mind\u2019\r\nPeter\u00a0is an Anglo-Scandinavian philosopher of mind and a metaphysician who specialises in the thought of Whitehead, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, with special regard to panpsychism and altered states of sentience. Peter received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Philosophy and a Master\u2019s degree in Continental Philosophy from the University of Warwick, where he was awarded a first-class distinction for his dissertation on Kant and Schelling in relation to \u2018intellectual intuition\u2019.

Many UK therapists, mental health nurses, teachers, health professionals and counsellors who have been through this course in the past have found it very useful to their work and personal development. You can read some of their testimonials below. The course is quality-checked by the\u00a0National Counselling Society and can count towards your CPD requirements.\u00a0CPD certificate will be issued on the day.\nSufferers: If you are a sufferer, you can also attend for this course. As an ex-anxiety sufferer myself, the course is designed not only to help the professionals sharpen their skills but also to enable sufferers to get their hands on a simple but effective recovery model to achieve personal transformation. You will learn about the steps that helped me transform my anxiety disorder, allowing me to start helping others around the world achieve similar life-changing transformation. The course environment is relaxed and reassuring, and you will be able to share your story with me if you want to, and ask questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Noted Benefits of Using the F.E.A.R Model\nThe following benefits have been gathered from both the sufferers and professionals who have used the F.E.A.R model either as a self-help tool or as a model for helping clients:\n\nHealth and fitness.\u00a0The FEAR Model helps restore the body to function as intended. Emotional stress and anxiety messes up the nervous\u00a0system,\u00a0increases emotional fatigue and degenerates the body quickly. By using the FEAR model steps regularly, you\u2019ll achieve heightened emotional well-being , a\u00a0higher level of energy, creativity, and greater life satisfaction. A sufferer who recently went through the course wrote the following feedback, \u201cVery good, informative, eye and mind opening. I wish I had known all that 20 years ago. It would have made my life much easier and successful.\u201d Also, since anxiety and stress often speed\u00a0up body degeneration, looking a lot younger has also been noted among regular users of the FEAR model steps. The FEAR Model steps can also be adapted to bring about natural weight loss by transforming the emotional and mental pathways that reinforce\u00a0weight-gain in the brain.\nPersonal transformation.\u00a0The FEAR model takes you or your client to a new, higher level regarding emotional wellbeing, work, relationship and makes you a different person in many ways. We become what we think about all the time. Once your thought-life has been transformed, life transformation is inevitable. A course attendee shared this testimonial\u00a0 recently. \u201cI am a\u00a0mum\u00a0of an anxious teenager (OCD). I now have a few more tools in my kit bag. Thought provoking. Simple techniques for what may be complex problems, but doable steps to recovery.\u201d\nPersonal Growth,\u00a0Influence\u00a0and Recognition. If you are a therapist in practice, most clients that will come to you are more likely to have received two or more therapy interventions in the past. They have come to you to see if you offer anything different and long-lasting from what they have experienced in the past. Mastering The FEAR model sets you apart from the pack by offering your clients a simple system that offers transformation and long-lasting effect than they have experienced in the past. This builds credibility, recognition and expands your practice, as a very happy client often tells as least 3 other prospects. Your clients will value and respect you more for your helpful insight and attention to details. All of these benefits come as a result of your desire for personal growth to explore the FEAR model. \u201cThe course was extremely helpful and informative. Interesting, excellent and enjoyable. It enables me to help so many adults and children within the support groups I run,\u201d J. Morgan, Parent Rep and Support Group Facilitator\nIt saves money and increases practice turn-over.\u00a0Many sufferers who have gone through the FEAR model course wished they had attended the course many years ago, as this would have saved them not just a lot of money but also time and a lot of emotional and physical pain. As a therapist in practice, we know that word of mouth is the most effective advertising tool especially for therapists in practice. This can translate to more organic referrals from transformed and happy clients, leading to the\u00a0increase in your turn-over as a practitioner.\n\n\nWhat Previous Attendees Were Saying:\n\n'Very good...informative, useful - well worth attending.' -- Dr C.

Relationships are very important. In a live event like this, there is ample opportunity to connect with like-minded people, share experiences, get motivated and discover what is working for others. I have been able to meet and connect with some amazing people in events such as this one.\nThe second reason why this is a subsidised event is the\u00a0feedback\u00a0that we get from our attendees. This is extremely useful. It helps us improve our courses and get better in serving others.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT\nAll you need to do is to register your ticket to attend this event now.\u00a0 The event is expected to be oversubscribed as there are very limited spaces. So book your seat now.\n\nIntroduction:\nGeneralised anxiety and panic disorder are often two of the easily noticeable signs of deep-seated issues. And if not treated properly, more complicated anxiety disorder outlets are inevitable. Studies have shown that nearly a quarter of the adult population will suffer from an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. Yet only a small percentage of these people actually receive effective treatments that deal with the root causes of anxiety and panic disorders. Perhaps, you yourself as a therapist or client, have seen people who have been through most of the mainstream anxiety recovery programmes with little or no improvement. The real epidemic is not the disorder itself, but our inability to provide adequate recovery treatment that focuses on unearthing the underlying root causes and permanently transforming the sufferers.In an era where too much attention has been given to antidepressants prescriptions and on the coping mechanisms that temporarily numb the symptoms as opposed to eliminating them, there is a vital need for a recovery programme that promises transformation, which every anxiety patient in our societies deserves. \nHopefully, you will be able to join us for this event.I look forward to seeing you there,Best regardsWale OladipoLead Coach & Therapist, Mind Body Breakthrough\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nCancellation:\nCancellation charges are applied in all cases.

        "description": "As part of Innovate UK\u2019s second Women in Innovation programme, KTN will be running four Building Success events in Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Belfast. Take the opportunity to network with like-minded women, learn from experts and hear from successful female entrepreneurs at these free to attend events. We'd encourage female founders and women working within innovation from all industries to attend.\r\nStarting at 8.30am with a networking breakfast the Building Success events will be an all-day event.\r\nThe morning session will include an overview of the funding and finance landscape, including regional support,\u00a0and upcoming opportunities from Innovate UK. After this there will be four masterclasses; two before lunch and two after.\r\nThe masterclasses available are:\r\n\r\nGrant writing masterclass:\u00a0When applying for a grant it often requires a significant investment of time to put forward a compelling case. Yet grants can be a real enabler in realising your innovative ideas and supporting business growth. So, what are the key elements that make a successful grant application? How can you make your application stand out from the crowd and deliver a competitive business case? Find out during this session.\r\nMarket validation:\u00a0Be equipped with tools and techniques to really gain understanding of your target market. Learn how to build this understanding into your proposed concept. This workshop helps develop a fundamental skill that ensures your concept is aligned with a true market need or challenge. The result? Product development has a clear route to market and the value you offer will be communicated to your customer with conviction.\u00a0\r\nInnovation canvas:\u00a0There are many problems that need to be solved on the way to a successful commercial innovation. We need a framework that poses the questions that a company must address to manage a process that is often tortuous and unpredictable. Borrowing from the model of the Business Model Canvas, KTN has developed an \u2018Innovation Canvas\u2019, which is divided into conversation blocks focused on the major issues that must be addressed in the innovation process. Join this workshop to apply your innovation and see which areas you need to focus on.\r\nInvestor readiness \u2013 helping you to understand what an investor is looking for:\u00a0Are you looking to secure investment to grow your business? In this workshop learn about what an investor looks for, how to find committed and interested investors and how to present your business through a memorable pitch.\r\n\r\nAfter an afternoon coffee and networking break, the final part of the day will involve a panel session with successful female entrepreneurs in your region, and talks from previous Women in Innovation award winners.\r\nThe event will conclude with a cheese and wine networking session finishing at 7.30pm.\r\nJoin the conversation on social media using #WomenInnovate",

        "description": "The VIVIT Experience is a nationally award winning academic experience offering you the chance to\u00a0participate in a recreated post mortem experience conducted on VIVIT -the worlds only semi-synthetic human cadaver. During this special 5 hour experience you will be taken on a scientifically accurate recreated human body dissection learning\u00a0in-depth anatomy and physiology\u00a0relevant to\u00a0your\u00a0academic studies. The course is interactive and designed to support those\u00a0students currently at The University of Ulster and any other students studying in the\u00a0biosciences, health, sports or associated degree pathways that require an understanding of advanced anatomy and physiology or indeed the associated clinical pathologies. The\u00a0procedure will be lead by Samuel Piri who will first set out the basics of\u00a0anatomical dissection before systematically working their way through the anatomical cavities comparing\u00a0normal specimens with various states of pathology. You will also be taught a variety of\u00a0important\u00a0clinical skills including interpreting X-rays and linking symptoms to\u00a0clinical diagnosis.\u00a0There will be the opportunity to ask questions and at the same time handle the\u00a0anatomical samples and even the chance to undertake some dissection for yourself.\nThere are 1 experience operating on the 15th March in Ulster. A daytime experience operating between 10.00am and 3.00pm.\u00a0\nAll tickets are sold subject to the ITAE Groups terms and conditions. All tickets are non refundable and non transferable. Strictly students over 16. No alcohol permitted. Photography and recorded footage will be taken.\nCopyright 2018.",

(do RSVP if you are planning on coming though, as we may postpone or finish early if we're expecting a small turnout)*</p> <p>A general space for anybody interested in open technologies (open source, open data or otherwise), to catch up and relax after work on Friday fortnights. People of all backgrounds, interests, skillsets and disciplines welcome.</p> <p>The Open Industry concept itself is about the ability of microentities and small businesses to collaborate formally on projects large and small, facilitated by open technologies - so we are combining the twin aims of:</p> <p>- giving tech freelancers, contractors and indies of all walks of technology life a focal point for an end-of-week (we need one too...), and</p> <p>- helping independents (and those considering a future step out) to link up to get sustainable open projects off the ground.</p>",
