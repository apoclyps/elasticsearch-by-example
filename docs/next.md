===========

We've covered quite a lot of things in this article. Still, we've barely scratched the surface of ElasticSearch's goodness.

For instance, there's a lot more to searching with ElasticSearch than we've seen here. We can create search requests where we specify how many hits we want, use highlighting, get spelling suggestions and much more. Also, the query DSL contains many interesting queries and filters that we can use. Then there's of course also a whole range of facets that we can use to extract statistics from our data or build navigations.

As if that wasn't enough, we can go far, far beyond the simple mapping example we've seen here to accomplish wonderful and interesting things. And then there are of course plenty of performance optimisations and considerations. And functionality to find similar content. And, and, and...

But for now, thanks for reading! I hope you found this tutorial useful on your way to discovering the great open source project ElasticSearch.
